# go-flare
Tools for the Flare network

If you are on Linux running should be as easy as
```
./go-flare
./go-flare send --help
```

Else you may have to go build or go run main.go

IMPORTANT: Do not send xUSD. Since it has less decimals you would send a huge amount, also when you check the balance of xUSD it is wrong by 12 decimalpoints.
