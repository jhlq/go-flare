# go-flare
Tools for the Flare network

If you are on Linux running should be as easy as
```
./go-flare
./go-flare send --help
```

Else you may have to go build or go run main.go

Available commands and their usage can be garnered from running go-flare and utilizing the help flag.

FLR-20 tokens operate with the same interface as ERC-20 ones.

If you want to use the commands directly in Go code import github.com/jhlq/go-flare/gflr and then look at the various files in the cmd directory, it should be pretty self explanatory.
